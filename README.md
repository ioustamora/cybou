# Cybou - Secure Cryptography App

A cross-platform Rust GUI application for secure cryptography using post-quantum algorithms and mnemonic-based key derivation.

## Features

### 🔐 Core Security

- **Mnemonic-based Key Derivation**: Uses BIP39 standard for secure key generation from 12/24-word phrases
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Implements NIST-recommended PQ algorithms
  - Kyber (ML-KEM) for key encapsulation and encryption
  - Dilithium (ML-DSA) for digital signatures
- **Hybrid Encryption**: Combines PQ key exchange with AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 for data encryption
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic key rotation with version management and backward compatibility
- **Secure Memory**: Uses zeroize crate for secure memory wiping
- **File Extensions**: Encrypted files use `.cybou` extension, decrypted files use `_decrypted` suffix

### 🖥️ User Interface

- **Multi-Window Architecture**: Separate windows for different functions with centralized window management
- **Window Coordinator**: Advanced window lifecycle management and coordination system
- **Dashboard**: Main window with key status, public key display, and quick actions
- **System Tray Integration**: Enhanced tray menu for opening specific windows
- **Native GUI**: Built with Slint for cross-platform compatibility
- **File Dialogs**: Native OS file/folder selection dialogs
- **Callback System**: Event-driven UI with proper memory management and thread safety

### 📁 Cryptographic Operations

- **Text Encryption/Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt text with base64 encoding
- **File Encryption/Decryption**: Secure file encryption with PQ + AES hybrid scheme
- **Folder Encryption**: Archive and encrypt entire directories
- **Digital Signatures**: Sign messages and verify signatures (verification API needs update)
- **Password Generation**: Generate secure random passwords with customizable complexity
- **Password Assessment**: Analyze password strength and security
- **Key Management**: View and export public keys, copy to clipboard
- **Backup System**: Automated deduplicating backup with real-time file watching ✅
  - File system monitoring with change detection
  - Content-based deduplication using BLAKE3
  - Progress tracking and verification
  - Multi-folder support with configurable destinations
  - Automatic cleanup of old backups
- **Cloud Storage**: Encrypted cloud backups with AWS S3 integration ✅
  - Secure upload/download to AWS S3 buckets
  - Integrated with existing encryption framework
  - Multi-cloud provider support (AWS, GCP, Azure planned)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- Windows/Linux/macOS

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cybou
cargo build --release
```

### Run

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Usage

1. **First Launch**: The app starts with the Mnemonic Management window for key setup
2. **Key Derivation**: Enter a valid 12 or 24-word BIP39 mnemonic phrase to derive PQ keys
3. **Main Dashboard**: After key loading, access all cryptographic functions
4. **Operations**:
   - **Text Encryption**: Encrypt/decrypt text messages
   - **File Encryption**: Encrypt/decrypt files (creates `.cybou` files)
   - **Digital Signatures**: Create and verify digital signatures
   - **Folder Encryption**: Encrypt entire folders (creates `.tar.cybou` files)
   - **Password Tools**: Generate and assess password strength
   - **Backup Management**: Configure automated backup system
   - **Cloud Storage**: Upload/download encrypted files to/from cloud storage
   - **Key Management**: View and export public keys

## Security Notes

- **Mnemonic Security**: Your mnemonic phrase is the master key to all your data
- **Key Storage**: Keys are derived on-demand and securely wiped after use
- **PQ Algorithms**: Uses NIST-standard post-quantum cryptography resistant to quantum attacks
- **Hybrid Scheme**: Combines PQ security with proven symmetric encryption
- **File Extensions**: Encrypted files use `.cybou` extension for easy identification
